                    <div class="content-panel active" id="basics"><h3>AMR Testing Basics</h3><p>Determining whether the right antibiotic will work on a pathogen is the ultimate goal of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) tests. Doctors use the results to make the best choices about treatment, which is critical both to making patients recovered and to preventing resistant strains from proliferating. Key concepts are the breakpoints, the formal designation of a bug as "susceptible" or "resistant," and the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), the lowest amount of the drug needed to keep a microbe from growing. Faster, more precise tests are among the most powerful among the instruments we have to improve patient outcomes while reducing antibiotic use.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="phenotypic"><h3>Phenotypic Methods</h3><p>The old, hands-on approach is to conduct phenotypic testing. To observe the effect of antibiotics, they grow bacteria inside the laboratory. They are resistant if they germinate; they're susceptible if they don't. It is yet the gold standard technique as it gives definitive results on the actual behavior that a microorganism exercises under the effect of a drug. Common techniques are the broth microdilation, as well as the disk diffusion, but they normally require 24 to 48 hours to exhibit results.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="molecular"><h3>Molecular Techniques</h3><p>Molecular techniques search for specific genes within the DNA of a pathogen that are recognized to produce resistance, rather than having to wait for the bacterium to grow. These tests would yield results within a few hours through technologies such as PCR. In situations where time is a matter of split seconds, this immediacy is a revolution. It is the biggest disadvantage that they may miss eccentric or exotic types of resistance because they only recognize what they've been programmed to recognize.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="sequencing"><h3>Sequencing Methods</h3><p>Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) provides the most extensive analysis of the genetic makeup of an infection. By creating a map of an outbreak's entire DNA, WGS can pinpoint all recognized resistance genes, identify new mutations, and track an outbreak. It is a highly effective tool for tracking public health as well as conducting research. However, increasing costs as well as the need for complex data processing have often limited its use. The rate at which labs used to be able to identify a pathogen has changed forever because of mass spectrometry, most notably the MALDI-TOF MS. It is capable, within a couple of minutes, of properly recognizing a strain of bacteria based on culture. Today, the researchers are also using it to spot tiny protein changes that indicate antibiotic resistance. By making identification almost instantaneous and making the likelihood of rapid resistance identification stronger, the technology also bridges the gap.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="mass-spec"><h3>Mass Spectrometry</h3><p>The speed with which labs could once identify a pathogen has been revolutionized by mass spectrometry, most notably MALDI-TOF MS. It can identify a strain of bacteria correctly within a few minutes from a culture. Today, scientists are also using it to uncover small protein changes that indicate antibiotic resistance. By making nearly instant identification possible and amplifying the likelihood that resistance identification could be rapid, this tool plays middleman.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="rapid"><h3>Rapid Diagnostics</h3><p>Answers fast are desirable. Point of Care tests, also commonly called rapid diagnostics, are designed to offer results to the patient during the time they are being treated within a few minutes. These devices, be it the microfluidic chip or the plain test strip, allow the physician to make the best decision instantly. They are valuable to the efficient stewardship, particularly where resources are limited medical facilities or the emergency rooms.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="automated"><h3>Automated Platforms</h3><p>Commercial or automated systems such as VITEK 2, BD Phoenix, and MicroScan WalkAway are standard fare in the current-day clinical laboratory for the conduct of antibiotic susceptibility testing. They are high-throughput systems that eliminate the manual process of inoculation, incubation, as well as interpretation, so that repetitive, standardized output is achieved across multiple antimicrobials as well as pathogens. By eliminating the manual procedure, as well as the human factor, the systems eliminate the former, hugely amplify the latter, as well as reduce turn-around-times, substantially, even significantly, in high-volume diagnostic labs.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="future"><h3>Comparison & Future</h3><p>Today's diagnostic choices are the fast speed offered by molecular testing that can identify known resistance genes, or indisputable but slow results from phenotypic testing. Sequencing gives the most rich picture of antibiotics resistance, but is costly. The future will be in combinations of these strengths. Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analysis, and CRISPR-based (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) [diagnostics] are intended to give us what we ultimately want, which is fast, inexpensive, and comprehensive testing for everybody, everywhere.</p></div>
