                    <div class="content-panel active" id="basics"><h3>AMR Testing Basics</h3><p>in this, we determine whether the appropriate antibiotic will work on a pathogen is the final goal of AMR tests. Doctors use this results to make the best possible choice about treatment, which should be critical both to make patients recovered and to prevent resistant strains from proliferating. key concepts include in this are the breakpoints, also can be determined whether the bug as "susceptible" or "resistant" and also the minimum inhibitory concentration(MIC),the lowest amount of drug needed to keep microbe from growing.  Faster, more precise tests are among the most powerful among the instruments we have to improve patient outcomes while reducing antibiotic use.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="phenotypic"><h3>Phenotypic Methods</h3><p>The old, hands-on approach is to conduct phenotypic testing. the bacteria is grown in laboratory to observe the effect of antibiotics on it. if they germinate indicates they are resistant. if they don't then they are susceptible, it is yet the gold standard technique as it allows the definitive results on the working of a microorganism under the effect of a drug. in this common techniques include the broth micro dilation, disk diffusion method , but also they normally require 24 to 48 hours to give the results.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="molecular"><h3>Molecular Techniques</h3><p>molecular techniques are used to search for the specific genes within the DNA of a pathogen which are recognized to produce the resistance, instead than having to wait till bacteria grows. These tests would yield results within a few hours through technologies such as PCR. In situations where time is a matter of split seconds, this immediacy is a revolution. It is the biggest disadvantage that they may miss eccentric or exotic types of resistance because they only recognize what they've been programmed to recognize.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="sequencing"><h3>Sequencing Methods</h3><p>Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) provides the most extensive analysis of the genetic makeup of an infection. By creating a map of an outbreak's entire DNA, WGS can pinpoint all recognized resistance genes, identify new mutations, and track an outbreak. It is a highly effective tool for tracking public health as well as conducting research. However, increasing costs as well as the need for complex data processing have often limited its use. it also uses MALDI-TOF MS. within couple of minutes, it recognizes the strain of bacteria based on the culture.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="mass-spec"><h3>Mass Spectrometry</h3><p>Labs identify a pathogen is time consuming whereas the MALDI-TOF MS. can do it with few minutes from a culture  Today, scientists are also using it to uncover small  protein changes that indicate antibiotic resistance. By making nearly instant identification possible  and amplifying the likelihood that resistance identification could be rapid, this tool plays middleman.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="rapid"><h3>Rapid Diagnostics</h3><p>Answers fast are desirable. here Point of Care tests which is also commonly known as rapid diagnostics, this are basically designed such way to offer results to the patient during the time when they are being treated within few minutes. these devices, can be microfluidic chip or even the plain test strip, this allow the physician to make the best decision in a short time . this are valuable to the stewardship, especially when resources are limited or the emergency rooms.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="automated"><h3>Automated Platforms</h3><p>here, commercial or also the automated systems such as VITEK-2, BD phoenix and many more are a standard fare in the current scenario for the conduct of antibiotic susceptibility testing. By eliminating the manual procedure, as well as the human factor, the systems eliminate the former, hugely amplify the latter, as well as reduce turn-around-times, substantially, even significantly, in high-volume diagnostic labs.</p></div>
                    <div class="content-panel" id="future"><h3>Comparison & Future</h3><p>Today's diagnostic choices are the fast speed offered by molecular testing that can identify known resistance genes, or indisputable but slow results from phenotypic testing. Sequencing gives the most rich picture of antibiotics resistance, but is costly. The future will be in combinations of these strengths. Technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analysis, and CRISPR-based (Clustered Regularly Interspersed Short Palindromic Repeats) [diagnostics] are intended to give us what we ultimately want, which is fast, inexpensive, and comprehensive testing for everybody, everywhere.</p></div>
