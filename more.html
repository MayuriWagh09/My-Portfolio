It also helps the scientists to rapidly access extensive amount of data, speeding up progress across various sectors. AI is also creating the potentiality of the discovery of newer drugs along with the designing of customized medicines.</p></div>

                    <div class="ai-card"><h3>Predicting Patterns of Resistance</h3><p>The machine learning scripts are able to predict the possible AMR patterns . this allows the public health community the advance warning even before the resistance patterns may emerges.</p></div>
                    <div class="ai-card"><h3>Speed-Up Drug Discovery</h3><p>rather than spending many years on the trial and error , the AI is very quick to detect off the shell chemical molecules which is can be studied if they are antibiotic actable or not. it reduces the time it takes to identify the new drugs.</p></div>
                    <div class="ai-card"><h3>Worldwide Surveillance</h3><p>AI tools and platforms keeps the global AMR data analyzed . the resistance of gene exchange i tracked. as well as the identification of hotspots and also the guide to global health policy.</p></div>

                <div class="about-text"><p>The term ESKAPE is an acronym for six bacterial pathogens that are notorious for their high levels of virulence and multidrug resistance: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6452778/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[1]</a></sup></p><p>In hospitals, these microorganisms frequently result in serious illnesses. Common antibiotics can "escape" their effects. Treatment is made more difficult by this resistance, which raises mortality rates and raises medical expenses.</p><p>The majority of ESKAPE diseases are on the World Health Organization's (WHO) priority list because of the severe threat they pose. This seeks to direct the urgent investigation and creation of novel antibiotics.</p></div>

(2) to improve the surveillance and research. (3) to reduce infections by better hygiene. (4) Optimizing the better use of all antimicrobial medicines.
