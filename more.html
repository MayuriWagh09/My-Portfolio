                <div class="about-text"><p>The term ESKAPE is an acronym for six bacterial pathogens that are notorious for their high levels of virulence and multidrug resistance: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.<sup><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6452778/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">[1]</a></sup></p><p>In hospitals, these microorganisms frequently result in serious illnesses. Common antibiotics can "escape" their effects. Treatment is made more difficult by this resistance, which raises mortality rates and raises medical expenses.</p><p>The majority of ESKAPE diseases are on the World Health Organization's (WHO) priority list because of the severe threat they pose. This seeks to direct the urgent investigation and creation of novel antibiotics.</p></div>

                <h2 class="section-title">WHO and AMR</h2>
                <div class="about-text"><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines AMR as the process where microbes change to resist the drugs meant to kill them. This makes infections much harder to treat. The WHO has identified AMR as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. The crisis mainly stems from the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals, and agriculture. This threatens to reverse many of modern medicine's key achievements.</p><p>The WHO‚Äôs Global Action Plan outlines a strategy for tackling this issue, concentrating on five main areas: (1) Raising awareness of AMR. (2) Improving surveillance and research. (3) Reducing infections by enhancing hygiene. (4) Optimizing the use of all antimicrobial medicines. (5) Promoting sustainable investment in new tools and treatments.</p></div>

                <div class="about-text"><p>The One Health approach is a straightforward but impactful idea. The health of people, animals, and our environment are all closely linked. This framework encourages teamwork across various sectors to monitor and control the spread of resistant microbes.</p><p>Since antimicrobials are used in human medicine, farming, and veterinary care, resistance that develops in one area can easily move to another. The One Health strategy is essential because it tackles these root causes wherever they arise, ensuring a unified and lasting effort to safeguard global health.</p></div>
